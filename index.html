        <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
        <h2> My hobby is playing badminton. Badminton is my favorite sport. When I get some free time after my studies,I go outside to the court with my friends and play Badminton. Badminton is the game which requires physical fitness. So, after playing badminton when I study, I can better grab the concepts. I also become delighted by playing badminton because I don’t waste my mind sitting
            in front of a computer or playing video games. Instead, I do some healthy activity. On every Sunday evening, I have two or three hours free. Mostly, I play badminton at that time. I have purchased my badminton kit. I also got another benefit of being
            a player of badminton. My skills of playing badminton have been increased, and I have been selected in my school team. In inter-school competition, I played brilliantly and gained victory for my school. My teachers and parents became very happy.
